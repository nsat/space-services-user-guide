# Tutorials

All tutorials require the [wrapper script](../ExecutionEnvironment.md#wrapper-script) to be deployed. Consider completing the prerequisites in the [Getting Started Guide](../GettingStarted.md).

The tutorials all follows a similar format. Each has it's own directory that contains a README with instructions, a `deploy` script to run from the users environment, and 1 or more scripts to upload to payloads on the satellites.
