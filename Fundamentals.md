# Fundamentals

Everything happens on a schedule. Time is booked on the satellite, and the "task" is attempted at the scheduled time.

## Satellite Bus
The satellite bus is a broad name given to the many systems that support a customers activities.  Spire maintains the satellite bus, which includes powering systems on and off, charging batteries, stationkeeping,  communicating with the ground and other satellites, and coordinating scheduled tasks. 

## Ground Station
Spire maintains ground-stations around the globe. The location & capabilities of each ground-station affects when a customer can expect their data to be uplinked or downlinked. Ground stations are fitted with some combination of UHF, S-BAND and X-BAND trancievers.

## Contact
A contact is one or two-way radio transmission between a statellite and a ground-station, or between two satellites (inter-satellite links). The purpose of a contacts is broad, but includes time for maintenance, schedule synchronization and the transfer of data. Spire schedules contacts for its exclusive use - customer code is not made aware of these contacts. Customers may schedule their own contacts between satellites or with a Spire ground-station. 

## Contact Schedule
Spire schedules time for the satellite to communicate with Spires ground-stations and other satellites. Customers may also schedule time for exculsive contact with another satellite or ground-station.

## Payload
Spire offers a range of computer types to run customer tasks on. These computers are referred to as "payloads". Payloads provide specialized hardware, i.e. GPU, trancievers or cameras. Customers are provided a persistent execution environment for applications and data. Each payload runs Linux and connected to the satellite bus via ethernet.
