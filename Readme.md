# Payload In Space

Payload in Space is the term used for users that own the payload(s) hosted by Spire on the satellite bus. Users may provide Spire any hardware they wish. Where the customer chooses to run Linux & configure the [necessary prerequisites](./PayloadInSpace.md), all of the [Software In Space](./Fundamentals.md) services are provided.
