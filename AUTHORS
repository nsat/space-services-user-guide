This site has been developed so that it renders well on [GitHub](https://github.com/nsat/space-services-user-guide/) and through [SlateDocs](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki). GitHub uses the markdown files (`.md`) directly, which SlateDocs uses the `.erb` files referenced by [`site.yml`](./site.yml) to customize the rendering of the markdown into HTML format.

Each `.erb` file may reference [js/update_links.md](./js/update_links.md) and/or [js/one_column.md](./js/one_column.md). `one_column.js` applies a `css` fix to ensure that code boxes render correctly in single column mode.  `update_links` serves two functions. Relative hyperlinks with the `.md` extension are replaced with `.html` so that the links work in SlateDocs. Secondly, any hyperlinks starting with `http` or `//` are updated to set the target to be a new window, and the FontAwesome "external-link" symbol appended.
